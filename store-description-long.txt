YouTube Music keeps showing a 'Saved to liked music' toast that never disappears on its own — only this one has an X button and stays forever. This extension clicks that close button for you automatically.

Features:
- Auto-dismisses only the 'Saved to liked music' toast
- Runs only on music.youtube.com
- No permissions beyond content script match
- Lightweight, zero network access

How it works:
The extension watches for the toast element to appear, verifies the text matches exactly 'Saved to liked music', then clicks the close button immediately.

Privacy:
This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. It runs entirely in your browser and only interacts with the YouTube Music page.
